This recipe for besan-chakki will give you melt in mouth burfi every time!

Roasting besan :-

Step 1.  Pour 120 gram ghee to a heavy bottom wide pan. Heat it on medium flame Move to the next step when it melts and turns hot.

Step 2. Then add 2 cups of besan (210 grams).

Step 3. Mix them and begin to fry stirring on medium flame for 3 to 4 minutes. Besan will absorb all of the ghee and the mixture will turn thick and clumpy at this time.

Step 4. After 3 to 5 minutes, reduce the flame to low. Stir continuously and fry it until the color of the besan changes to deep golden. Stir it non-stop otherwise it will burn. 

Step 5. After about 20 minutes of constant stirring and frying, the color of the besan changes to deep golden and begins to smell aromatic. We don't want it to turn brown otherwise it will taste bitter.

Step 6. Take it off the stove and continue to stirr for another 2 minutes. Keep this aside to cool down.
 
(If desireable :- Add condensed milk after turning besan to deep golden.)

Making sugar syrup :-

Step 1. Add 225 grams sugar & pour half cup of water to a pan. Stir well to dissolve it completely and bring this to boil on a medium heat.

Step 2. Let it cook for a few minutes until it reaches a 1 string consistency. Turn down the heat to low while you check the string consistency.

Step 3. To check the 1 string consistency, take a few drops of syrup in between your thumb and forefinger. Separate the fingers gently. You should see a long string. Turn off the heat as soon as you see this consistency.

Step 4. Set this aside to cool down slightly.

Making besan chakki:-

Step 1. Roasted besan must be warm or slightly hot. Pour half of the syrup to the warm besan. Mix it continuously until well blended.

Step 3. Pour it to the greased tray or you can use butter paper as well in the tray. The texture and consistency will be thick at this stage.
